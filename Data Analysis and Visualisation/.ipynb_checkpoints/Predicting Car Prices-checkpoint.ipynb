    "<h1>Applying K-Nearest Neighbors: Predicting Car Prices</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the DataQuest Machine Learning course, I have been exploring the fundamentals of machine learning using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. In this project, I'll practice the machine learning workflow I've learned so far to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set I will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more."
